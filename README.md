# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game in which the players fill up nine empty rectangles in a table with either an X or an O when it is their turn. Once someone succeeds to line up their sign vertically or horizontally without an interruption, that player wins. With our help you can make a multiplayer browser game, which you can play with a friend.
To stay organized and optimized when making games, you should separate different parts of code into different files. For our Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game we will use only three different files since it is a simple game. In the index.html we will assign classes to all separate constructors of our game. We will style our game in the style.css. Last but not least we will write our script in the script.js. 
The gameplay will start with the x character, so that automatically makes x the first player. 

#HTML for the Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game
Starting off with HTML. This is the most simple and short part of our code. Here we will assign classes and ids to our HTML elements. Since this game is made of a board with cells inside, we will construct the cells with the <div> element. This means we will just create generic containers which we will style later. Our board will be as simple as possible.

#CSS â€“ styling our game
The upcoming part of our code is where you can let your imagination and creativity loose. In the stylesheet we will use our id tags and classes to personalize the visuals of our game. All the way from borders and line width to colours and text size. Since this part of the code can be completely personalized you can either write it from scratch, suitable for your own preferences. You can also just change the colors, size, fonts etc.
